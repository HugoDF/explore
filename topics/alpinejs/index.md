short_description: A rugged, minimal framework for composing JavaScript behavior in your markup.
topic: alpinejs

Alpine.js offers you the reactive and declarative nature of big frameworks like Vue or React at a much lower cost.

You get to keep your DOM, and sprinkle in behavior as you see fit.

Think of it like [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for JavaScript.
